Charts the number of pages per day on the infectious diseases consult service

All of my pages come to me via SMS. I export these messages into an [Mbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file. `paging_burden.ipynb` takes the Mbox file, extracts SMS from the paging systems of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) and the Jewish General Hospital (JGH), and plots the number of pages per day like below:

On the left is when I was covering the MUHC, and on the right was JGH. Team A at the JGH covers most of the hospital, while Team B covers intensive care and hematology consults.
